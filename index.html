      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        My wife has been a hairstylist for 6 years. For the first year, she was
        working at a salon as an assistant, where she gained enough experience
        to make the decision to start getting her own clientele. Like any other
        entrepreneur, she was scared at the beginning, but that never stopped
        her from always doing her best to provide a high-quality service to any
        client. Since day one, her only mission is to be able to share her
        skills with others and help them to boost their confidence, as she
        always says “Being a hairstylist is not only changing the color or style
        of someone else’s hair, is having the opportunity of helping someone to
        feel better about themselves, everyone has problems, insecurities or
        just a bad day, but when they come to get their hair done, is my chance
        to help them to leave my salon not just looking different, but being
        different”
      </p>
      <p>
        Her business has grown so much in the last year that I want to help her
        use my skills by creating a website where she can share her talent. The
        purpose of this website is to share her work and help her clients to
        make appointments with her.
      </p>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The audience will be any women from Utah County that would like to get
        their hair done by my wife. The website will be easy to use with only 3
        pages in the navigation (home, booking, and about me pages). Her current
        and new clients will be able to see some of her work on the home page,
        they will be able to make appointments for any service she provides, and
        they will be able to learn more about my wife’s background and story on
        the about me page.

          where to go in case they are new or current customers.
