      This third page will be used to introduce Stephanie to new clients, it
      will be a page where she can share his love and passion for being a
      hairstylist.

      It will mostly include two paragraphs with a little background and her
      mission and vision. This will be some of the text that I am going to

    <h2>Get to know me!</h2>
    <p>
      From a very young a age hair has always been one of my passions. I've been
      doing hair for 6 years now, I love to continue my education to keep up
      with trends. what I do doesn't feel like a job, I love putting a smile on
      peoples face, listening to what's going on in their life's. My job is my
      hobby, favorite past-time and valued quality time with people I admire and
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is thatevery client receives an outstanding service from the time
      they walk in, to the time they walk out. I want my cliens to love my work
      so much that they would refer me to their friends, their famil, and even
      complete strangers who approach them anywhere. My mission is to create a
      place where everyone feels confortable and welcome!
