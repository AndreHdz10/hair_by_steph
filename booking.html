      This second page will be created to provide a space where Stephanie's
      clients can come and make an appointment. As the wireframe shows, this
      page will contain an introductory message to ensure the customer knows
      where to go in case they are new or current customers.
    </p>

      The three services that Stephanie Hair provides (Balayage, Haircuts, and
      Extensions) will be the three buttons that the wireframe shows.
